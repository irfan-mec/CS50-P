# Main Repository: CS50-P

Welcome to the **CS50P - Introduction to Programming with Python** repository. This repository contains the problem sets and final project completed as part of Harvard University's CS50P course. This course covers foundational concepts in programming and computational thinking, using Python as the primary language.

## Contents

1. **Problem Sets:**
   - Nine problem sets designed to enhance your understanding of Python programming concepts.
   - Each problem set folder contains:
     - Source code files (.py)
     - A `README.md` with problem descriptions and solutions overview.

2. **Final Project:**
   - A comprehensive project that demonstrates the application of concepts learned during the course.
   - Details about the project can be found in its respective folder.

## Skills Gained

- Python Programming (Variables, Data Structures, Functions, etc.)
- File Handling
- Debugging and Testing
- API Integration
- Computational Problem Solving
